Monokai
=======

Visual Studio theming patterned after the [TextMate][1] theme [Monokai][2] by [Wimer Hazenberg][3], more recently popularized as the default theme in the wonderful [Sublime Text][4].

I believe this Visual Studio theme started with the theme by [Michael Monteleone][5], though I can't remember for sure. I probably started with the subset of colors provided at the time by [StudioStyles][6].

Currently, only Visual Studio 2012 Fonts and Colors are included, and are assumed to be used with the Light chrome theme.

To apply, go to Tools -> Import and Export Settings -> Import selected environment settings.
